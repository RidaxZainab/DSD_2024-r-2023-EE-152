In Lab 5 of Digital Systems Design, you explored the design and implementation of a seven-segment display decoder using truth tables, Karnaugh maps (K-maps), and FPGA-based design with Vivado.

## Task 1: Truth Tables

Cathode Truth Table: This table specifies which segments (a-g) are illuminated for each hexadecimal input (0-F).

Anode Truth Table: This table outlines the logic for selecting and activating the appropriate seven-segment display.

## Task 2: Karnaugh Maps and Boolean Equations

K-maps were utilized to simplify the logic for each segment (A-G), leading to minimized Boolean expressions for each.
## Task 3: Logical Implementation

The derived Boolean equations were implemented using basic logic gates.
## Task 4: FPGA Circuit Design

Vivado Circuit Diagrams:

Cathode Control Circuit: Manages which segments are lit based on input values.

Anode Control Circuit: Determines which display is active at any given time.

## Tasks 5 & 6: Timing Analysis

Maximum Combinational Delay:

 Synthesis: 6.823 ns

Implementation : 11.818 ns
